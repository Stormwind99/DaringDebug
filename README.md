# Daring Debug

Do you DARE to see extra debug information in Minecraft?

This mod just adds a TileEntity-under-cursor entry to debug screen.  That's it.  Nothing else (yet).

This display is useful for configuration of mods that need TileEntity registration names, like [Food Funk](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk).  By looking at a block with the debug screen active, if the block has a TileEntity attached it will display the Forge registration name of that TileEntity with the prefix "TileEntity:" under the block name.  You can then use this name in configuration files for other mods which require TileEntity registration names.
